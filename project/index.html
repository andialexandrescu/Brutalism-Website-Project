                <h3>Brutalism, a term derived from the French "béton brut" or raw concrete, emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction to the sleek and sterile structures that dominated the architectural landscape at the time. This style is characterized by its use of raw, exposed concrete and a strong, blocky aesthetic. Its proponents saw brutalism as a way to strip away unnecessary ornamentation and create buildings that were honest, straightforward, and deeply human.</h3>
                <p>Brutalist architecture is a style of building design developed in the 1950s in the United Kingdom following World War II. With an emphasis on unpolished materials, the aesthetic evolved as reconstruction efforts were underway in the post-war era and began spreading across Europe and other parts of the world.</p>
                <p>At the time, there were multiple overlapping events and philosophies that contributed to the emergence of Brutalist structures. Spinning off the heels of the modernist movement of the day, architects were presented with a new set of challenges, namely limited resources, when designing in the post-war era. Additionally, young architects in particular felt that modernism represented little more than an aesthetic language, and sought to create structures rooted in functionalism and monumental expression.</p>
                <p>It was French-Swiss Modernist architect Le Corbusier who began building brutalist structures. He began designing in such a manner in the 1950s, and they soon became popular worldwide. Other architects who helped popularise brutalist design include Alison and Peter Smithson, Marcel Breuer, and Ernő Goldfinger.</p>
                <p>New brutalism is not only an architectural style; it is also a philosophical approach to architectural design, a striving to create simple, honest, and functional buildings that accommodate their purpose, inhabitants, and location. Stylistically, brutalism is a strict, modernistic design language that has been said to be a reaction to the architecture of the 1940s, much of which was characterised by a retrospective nostalgia.</p>
                <p>With countless examples spanning countries and continents, the look has both historical significance and remains popular—particularly in residential design—today.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Concrete, the principal building material of Brutalism, was cheap to produce and easy to construct into architectural elements. Brutalism put function before form and relied on juxtaposing itself with the old-timey elitist architecture covered in decorative elements. Focusing on brutalist architecture was also an anti-nostalgic gesture of minimizing class differences and offering equal opportunities for the vast majority of citizens.</p>
        <p>Despite the seeming monolith greyness of Brutalist architecture, its structure is much more complex and consists not only of concrete but of light as another crucial building material. Part of the aesthetic appeal of Brutalism lies within the play of ethereal light soaking through heavy concrete structures and interlocking planes. <i>One of the most brilliant examples of American Brutalism is the Geisel Library, built for San Diego University.</i> The architect William Pereira added Futurist influence to the concrete structure, turning it into a shining spaceship. Pereira balanced the complexity of planes and levels with rows of long horizontal windows which allowed light to cut through the heavy grey mass. The flexibility of concrete structures allowed architects to tailor their buildings according to the needs of particular regions and climates. For instance, many Brutalist buildings designed for Great Britain try to make the most out of limited sunlight, while in Kazakhstan, Brutalist designs deliberately block excessive heat and light.</p>
        <p>Despite its Western European origins, Brutalist architecture gained the most popularity in the Soviet Union. The idea of prioritizing function before form was a direct reflection of communist ideology and the dream of a new society of equal citizens. Moreover, Brutalism, devoid of any specific cultural elements, was truly international and thus worked in sync with the idea of cohabitation and unity. However, some Soviet Brutalist buildings nonetheless soaked in some local influences, either in the shape of functional elements like windows or doors or through settling in the natural environment around them. Today, the legacy of Soviet Brutalism can still be found in Eastern Europe and Baltic countries. Some governments see these architectural works as important pieces of cultural heritage, while others look at them as remnants of the tragic past of oppression.</p>
        <p>The history of Brutalism and its reception is rooted in paradox. Originally created as a means to cater to public needs, it was hated by people but adored by overly intellectual art critics who equated raw concrete environments for humans to natural habitats for animals. However, urban development experts believe that Brutalist environments are austere, unwelcoming, and estranging, impacting the mental well-being of residents. Some argue that the absence of color, texture, and organic shapes in concrete structures correlates with the prevalence of mental health issues, particularly depression. In the 1980s, certain architectural authorities linked the proliferation of Brutalist architecture with escalating crime rates. It emerged that architectural deficiencies could compromise both mental and physical security for the public. Despite being built as a long-term solution for comfortable and functional modern living, Brutalist architecture soon demonstrated its tragic potential. The novelty of the invention wore off, and without the initial enthusiasm, the flaws started to reveal themselves.</p>

                <ul> 
                    <li>Engineering as design: Modernist architects believed that the task of modern architecture is to embrace the potential of new construction materials such as reinforced concrete and modular beams to create radically new forms. Brutalist architects took this a step further by insisting that new engineering elements be visible on the exterior of buildings. In doing so, they sought to unmask the aesthetic properties of industrial technology and mass production. </li> 
                    <li>Honesty in materials: By the 1950s, modernist architects had engaged in a decades-long love affair with concrete, using it to create uninterrupted curtain walls and unexpected curves in their buildings. Brutalist architects continued this by eschewing paint altogether to reveal the original color and texture of molded concrete, at times even leaving mold creases undisturbed. </li> 
                    <li>Modularity: Modern production methods favor the repetition of forms. Therefore, it was common for brutalist architects to create designs that involved repeating structures and forms. Accordingly, many brutalist buildings appear as if they are the physical realization of mathematical patterns and controlled geometric variations. </li> 
                    <li>Exposed systems: Modernists were keen on noting that a building, much like an organism, contains distinct systems that allow it to function properly. This includes electrical systems, water distribution systems, waste distribution systems, and human mobility systems (such as elevators, stairwells, and passageways). Brutalist architects built on this observation by exploring the aesthetic potential of these functional elements. It is thus common to see exposed vents and pipes on the interior and exterior of brutalist architecture. </li>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Timidly appearing in the 1940s in Europe, brutalist architecture became hugely popularized after the destruction of the Second World War, which prompted a construction deluge. The architectural style generated by concrete proved suitable for rebuilding a devastated continent but continued to dictate architectural trends for another two decades. The new style operated around the material, which demonstrated the versatility of use and proved equally adaptable for various buildings, be it a school, a museum, a city complex, or residential buildings. </p>
            <p>Architects worldwide embraced brutalism, and each explored its flexibility by introducing an individual imprint in their design and style applied to concrete buildings. Here, we present some unmissable brutalist architects who shaped our urban landscapes and proposed a design for a new city transformed by concrete.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Le Corbusier </strong>(1187-1965)</h4>
                    <p>French-Swiss architect and city planner Le Corbusier were one of the most influential architects of the 20th century and the leading proponent of brutalist architecture. </p>
                    <p>The heavy emphasis on functionalism, bold expressionism, sculptural form, and efficient spaces sets his architectural design apart. UNESCO named 17 of his architectural works World Heritage sites by 2016.</p>
                    <p>Renouncing the decorative arts at an early stage paved the way for the pivotal Villa Savoye in Poissy, which exemplified the theoretical principles expressed in the Five Points of Architecture, a critical essay published in 1923 that determined the path of modern architecture, followed by numerous architects around the world.</p>
                    <p>Le Corbusier's Unite d'habitation, an exceptional example of brutalism, presented a novel residential typology developed around those principles, which was built in several European cities and provided a worldwide model for a collective housing building. The most extensive urbanistic project executed in the brutalist vernacular surfaced in Chandigarh, India, and comprises a comprehensive urban plan for the new capital. Additionally, Le Corbusier personally designed the most significant buildings built within the city, such as the Palace of Assembly and the High Court of Justice.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Marcel Breuer </strong>(1902-1981)</h4>
                    <p>Marcel Breuer was an American architect born in Hungary in 1902. He's one of the leading figures of brutalist architecture. His most famous works include the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City and the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris.</p>
                    <p>After shortly studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Marcel Breuer (1902 – 1981) enrolled at the Weimar Bauhaus under the mentorship of legendary Walter Gropius. The interdisciplinary approach of Bauhaus enabled Breuer to rise to prominence both as a brutalist architect and a furniture designer. At the behest of Gropius, Breuer moved to the city of London in 1937 before relocating to the U.S. to follow his mentor at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. Breuer's Wassily Chair and the Cesca Chair redefined the possibilities in furniture design, and his noteworthy buildings, such as the IBM Laboratory in La Gaude and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, verified the quality of Brutalism to merge monumentality and functionality.</p>
                    <p>Brauer's unmissable building for the Armstrong Rubber Company, built in 1969, represents an outstanding example of brutalist qualities evoked in the building’s adaptability to a change of use. After it was known as the Pirelli Tire Building, it housed IKEA for a time before transforming into a hotel named Hotel Marcel as a tribute to its creator.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Paul Rudolph </strong>(1918-1997)</h4>
                    <p>Kentucky-born Paul Rudolph is one of the most significant American architects who made his mark in residential and institutional buildings.</p>
                    <p>Rudolph attained his education at Auburn University and the Harvard Graduate School of Design and attended Bauhaus for three years. In the early 1950s, Rudolph was based in Sarasota, Florida, expressing his modernist approach in numerous educational facilities and housing projects. This significant beginning defined him as an early proponent of the regional style marked as the Sarasota School of Architecture. Rudolph became a brutalist architect in the second half of the decade, shortly before being elected chair of Yale University's Department of Architecture.</p>
                    <p>The Rudolph Hall, formerly the Yale Art and Architecture Building, completed in 1963, announced a new era in Rudolph's oeuvre, leading to his concrete masterpiece, the Milam Residence, designed and opened in 1961, and a prime example of sculptural brutalism.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Erno Goldfinger </strong>(1902-1987)</h4>
                    <p>The brutalists architect of Hungarian origin, Erno Goldfinger moved to London in the 1930s after graduating from the prestigious Ecole nationale supérieure des beaux arts in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Strongly influenced by Le Corbusier, Goldfinger transferred the principles of the Modernist architectural movement to his numerous educational and residential projects in the UK. However, Goldfinger is the most memorable with his housing structures, strongly imbued with a brutalist doctrine. </p>
                    <p>The Balfron Tower, the nearby Carradale House in Poplar, and the later Trellick Tower in Kensal Town stand tall as monuments to Goldfinger's mastery, which ensure him an important place in the history of brutalism.</p>
