                <p>The Karaburma residential housing tower is often referred to by locals at the Toblerone Tower, a nod to the triangular shapes incorporated into the design of the tower. It was designed by Rista Šekerinski and completed in 1963.</p>
                <p>The apartment block stands in the Belgrade neighborhood of Karaburma, near Pancevo bridge and  is one of several landmarks in the former Yugoslav capital built in the brutalist architectural style.</p>

                <h1>Alexandra and Ainsworth Estate, London</h1>
                <p>The Alexandra Road estate (officially the Alexandra and Ainsworth estate, but often referred to as Rowley Way, the name of its main thoroughfare) is a housing estate in the London Borough of Camden, North West London, England. It was designed in a brutalist style in 1968 by Neave Brown of Camden Council's Architects Department. Construction work commenced in 1972 and was completed in 1978. It is constructed from site-cast, board-marked white, unpainted reinforced concrete. Along with 520 apartments, the site also includes a school, community centre, youth club, heating complex, and parkland.</p>
                <p>Alexandra Road is London terrace house with the design of high-density public housing. Alexandra road represents the application of the terraced theme on an enormous scale.</p>
                <p>The long site is consisted of three parallel rows of dwellings. Two rows of terraced apartments are aligned along the tracks with the higher 8 story stepped building designed to block the noise of the trains. A lower, 4-story block runs along the other side of a continuous public walkway that serves both terraced rows of buildings. The third row of building, along the southern edge of the site, parallels another public walkway between this row and the existing earlier buildings of the Ainsworth Estate and defines an open public park between the second and third row of dwellings.</p>

                <h1>Double Helice, Paris</h1>
                <p>Another alluring construction out in Noisy-le-Grand, this multi-storey parking lot is known as the 'double helix' for its photo-worthy twists and bends. Like a crash-landed concrete UFO, Ludovic Maillard’s ’70s masterpiece wouldn’t look out-of-place in a sci-fi blockbuster.</p>
                <p>A place of happiness, it's a deserted, giant architecture in beautiful aged concrete, with texture and imperfections. There are 4000 parking spaces spread over four levels served by two helical ramps. Like a space station attached to the Arcades shopping center, the parking lot is intended for residents as well as customers of the shops, office employees, and RER users, who also pass through it to quickly reach the Abraxas Spaces. </p>

                <p>Hotel Salyut is a hotel on a green hill at the right side of the Dnieper River, it is surrounded by lush greenery of the Pechersk District which is the administrative and cultural center of Kiev. Designed in 1976, and built by 1984 by the Ukrainian architect Abraham Moiseevich Miletsky, together with N. Slohotska and Vladimir Shechenko, features 88 comfortable guestrooms of different categories with wonderful views of the UNESCO protected Kyivo-Pecherska Lavra and also the Dnieper River.</p>
                <p>In the beginning the project of construction for this interesting building was supported by the Communist party leadership, however, after the collective refused to add the curator from the party on the list of authors, the construction project slowly began to decelerate. This is the main reason why the hotel did not complete as initially planned, which at the beginning was supposed to be a skyscraper designed with application of interesting and cutting edge construction for that time. Also the budget for the construction entailed problems, making the building to have less floors than first planned where the plans had to change with the ongoing problems.</p>

                <h1>Torre Velasca, Milan</h1>
                <p>The Torre Velasca is a skyscraper built in the 1950s by the BBPR architectural partnership, in Milan, Italy. The tower is part of the first generation of Italian modern architecture, while still being part of the Milanese context in which it was born, to which also belongs the Milan Cathedral and the Sforza Castle. It  is located in the city centre of Milan, near the Duomo (Milan Cathedral) and the headquarters of the University of Milan.</p>
                <p>The tower, measuring 75 metres (246 ft) in height to the roof with an additional 23-metre-tall (75 ft) antenna spire (total 98 m or 322 ft), has a peculiar and characteristic mushroom-like shape. It stands out in the city skyline, made of domes, buildings and other towers. Its structure recalls the Lombard tradition, made of medieval fortresses and towers, each having a massive profile. In such fortresses, the lower parts were always narrower, while the higher parts were propped up by wood or stone beams.</p>
                <p>At the same time, BBPR in this building satisfied the functional needs of space: narrower surfaces on the ground, wider and more spacious ones on the top floors. The town planning laws, then, imposed specific volumes (depending on the buildings' purpose); in this tower, the latter were the mixed functions of residential and commercial use.</p>
